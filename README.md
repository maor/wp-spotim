Real-time comments widget turns your site into its own content-circulating ecosystem. Implement an innovative conversation UI and dynamic newsfeed to spur user engagement, growth, and retention.

## Description ##

Spot.IM Comments is an advanced, real-time commenting platform that gives website publishers direct ownership of their users’ conversation and social output. In only 5 minutes, your website can be host to a live, vivid community that lives not on Facebook or Twitter, but on your very own pages. 

Spot.IM Comments seamlessly incentivizes your users to create engaging User Generated Content through beautifully designed, real-time conversation. With a chat UI, your readers will interact with each other and hold discussions like never before. It features group and private messaging, as well as a live, smart newsfeed that directs your community members to your newest, hottest content. Spot.IM is more than a comment box. It is a commenting ecosystem centered on your, and only your, website. 

With Spot.IM, we’re on a mission to create a more involved and dedicated community on each and every site we work with. For you, the publisher, this means higher retention rates, more pageviews, and increased dwell time. Instead of allowing your content to leak out to social networks that you can’t control, we’re giving you back the power of its ownership. 

**Experience Live Commenting**
Typing users and submitted comments are seen in real time, allowing your users to produce User Generated Content like never before. There’s no waiting, no delay, and none of the frustrating load times that lead to poor site performance. Your users have less patience than ever before, and you need a system that addresses that.

**Innovative Chat Interface**
A revolutionary chat UI is integrated into the commenting experience to stimulate vibrant and instantaneous conversations. See if a user is online, and engage them in a free-flowing dialogue in either group or direct message. Hosting meaningful conversations has never been this seamless.

**Dynamic Newsfeed**
Hot topics and trending conversations are presented in a cross-site Newsfeed, driving discussion, clicks, and increased time on site for your users. The Newsfeed is specific to each site and optimized to draw your visitors in and give them a personal feel, keeping them interested and engaged with your content. It resides in an unobtrusive yet attractive button that constantly sits above-the-fold of your website, encouraging users to generate UGC before they even get to the comments section.

**Social Elements**
We’ve taken some core social functionalities and integrated them into Spot.IM’s system, giving your users the feeling of being inside a social network in your very own site. Like and share messages, tag community members in real-time with a simple “@”, share a large variety of media easily, and send and receive actionable notifications. 

**Mobile Integration**
In today’s world, mobile functionality is everything. That’s why Spot.IM is immediately optimized for all mobile platforms, ensuring that your users get just as much out of your site when they’re on the go as when they’re at home.

What is SEO and does Spot support it? 

	SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. When you’re asking if Spot.IM has SEO, you’re asking if Spot allows all of your User Generated Content (UGC) to be indexed on your site so that a search engine like Google, or Bing, can read it. 

	The answer to that question is yes! Spot.IM is SEO-compatible. Unlike other popular commenting systems like Disqus or Facebook Comments, Spot.IM not only allows your UGC to be indexed and searched, it indexes that content only on your site itself. Other commenting systems use their own 3rd party destination websites to index your UGC, which means that when keywords are searched, their content comes up, and not yours. 

	With Spot.IM, your content is your content, no matter if its an article you wrote or a user conversation in the comment section. This gives your website improved visibility in every way. 


How do I get mobile working for my Spot?

**	The language of the user’s browser determines the language of the interface:** If a user is using a browser in French, they will see the translated interface in French, etc.  

	Is spam filtered?
	Yes. To go along with other moderation tools, Spot.IM offers extensive word filter, blacklist, and spam control tools. 


How much does it cost?
